# First, i started by looking at all the files I could. But it was taking too long.. Then, i realized I only needed the files belonging to user flag00. For that, I will use the 'find' command: 

find / -user flag00 2>/dev/null

# This command will return all the files belonging to flag00 starting from the path '/'. I am using 2>/dev/null in order to redirect error output.

/usr/sbin/john
/rofs/usr/sbin/john

# When i cat these files they return: 

cdiiddwpgswtgt

# First, i tried that as a password but it didn't work. So i uses dcode.fr to try some rot and found this :

nottoohardhere

# This is the password.
